# Setup

To setup the project follow the the next steps. It's important to create an `.env` file based on the required environment variables in `.env.sample` before running the application.

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/kecioch/showtime
```

## Frontend

```bash
# 2.1 Navigate into repository
$ cd frontend

# 2.2 Install dependencies
$ npm i --force

# 2.3 Rename .env.sample to .env file and fill out the environment variables

# 2.4 Start frontend
$ npm run start
```

> **_NOTE_**: Because the frontend uses version 3.0.0 of the react-qr-reader package which doesn't support react 18.2 officially at the moment, you need to use the _--force_ paramter to install the packages.
